# BigSky sample application

This is a sample application submitted in response to a developer challenge from
[*Geo-Spatial Solutions*](http://geospatialsolutions.com) and [*GIS Direct*](http://gisdirect.com)

by [Ben Rosas](http://github.com/ballPointPenguin)

This application focuses primarily on the following objectives:
1. Present web based maps with user data on top of commercial mapping products. 
2. Present interactive aerial photography map of Montana. 
3. Present interactive map of Montana parcel data from GISDirect combined with aerial photography. 
4. Present interactive map of Montana irrigation features. 

The [ArcGIS JavaScript API](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis) is used,
along with RESTful calls to the [ArcGIS Map Service](http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisserver/apis/rest/index.html).

This application is built with Ruby (v.1.9.3) on Rails (v.3.2.5), along with Javascript (jQuery, Dojo, etc.).
The application is deployed via [Heroku](http://ggs-bigsky.herokuapp.com) with source code at [Github](http://www.github.com/ballPointPenguin/bigsky).
